            Come keep us company. We have a little community here. Anything is on topic but the large majority of discussion is related
            to security and/or BlackArch.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you need help, this is the best place to ask.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also have a little bot that notifies the channel of git commits and package updates/additions.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can find the official BlackArch IRC channel here:
            <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/blackarch" target="_blank">#blackarch</a> on Freenode
        </p>
        <p>
            If you aren't familiar with the protocol IRC, use the

                target=_blank>webchat</a> of Freenode. Just enter any nickname and the channel #blackarch
