BlackArch is an Arch Linux-based GNU/Linux distribution for pentesters and security researchers. The BlackArch package repository is compatible with existing Arch installs.


Here are some BlackArch features :

* Support for i686 and x86_64 architectures
* Over 600 tools (constantly increasing)
* Modular package groups
* A live ISO with multiple window managers, including dwm, Fluxbox, Openbox, Awesome, wmii, i3, and Spectrwm.
* An installer with the ability to build from source.



Soon we will release :


* ARM support
* Documentation for all tools



We are also releasing a tool to fetch and search exploit archives called [sploitctl](https://github.com/BlackArch/sploitctl/blob/master/sploitctl.sh). The [nullsecurity](http://www.nullsecurity.net/) team is an official supporter of BlackArch. We have a relaxed development structure. We welcome pull requests of all sizes through [Github](https://github.com/BlackArch) and [email](mailto:team@blackarch.org). Also see our [website](http://www.blackarch.org), [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/blackarchlinux), and [IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/blackarch).


Please report bugs and feature/tool requests through Github, email, twitter, or IRC. Feel free to post requests for your own tools.
