We have recently relocated all packages in the repository to comply with [FHS](http://www.pathname.com/fhs/). We would like to hear from anyone that was familiar with the _/pentest_ path structure and how they feel about the current format. Did anyone depend on _/pentest_ to remember what packages you have in your arsenal? Do you prefer having all packages available to you in your _$PATH_?

Please feel free to comment below and speak your mind!
