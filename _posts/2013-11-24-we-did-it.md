title: We did it!
---

Thanks to everyone's interest in this project we finally pissed off our ISP! It makes us happy to know that so many people appreciate our hard work and are using BlackArch Linux. We have managed to push a record 1.2TB a month of traffic and downloads. The shiny new server is up and alive, thank you for being patient with us. We are currently replicating mirrors across the USA to help with any potential future disruptions. For the latest updates please come back and visit us or follow us on twitter.

Thanks everyone!
