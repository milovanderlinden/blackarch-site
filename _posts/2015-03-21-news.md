title: Tool count breaks 1200 and upcoming ISOs...
---

BlackArch now contains more than 1200 packages. We will add the new packages to the next version of the ISO. If you wish to become a beta tester join our [IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/blackarch) on Freenode.

In addition to over 150 new packages and a number of features, the new BlackArch ISOs will include bugfixes for the current installer. They will be released in a couple of days.

Also, in parallel, we are working on a new installer written in Python which will have a text- and a curses-based installer modes. Once the new installer is finished, we will release new ISOs yet again.

Stay tuned...
