* network stack tunings (sysctl + tuning.sh)
* added system/pacman clean-up script (consistency++)
* switched to terminus font (console, LXDM, WMs, x-terminals, ...)
* replaced second browser midori with chromium
* really, a lot of clean-ups and many tweaks!
* renamed ISO filename
* fixed awesome-wm quit/exit issue
* fixed system group and user failures
* fixed kernel module load failures
* update blackarch installer to version 0.7 (bugfix + many improvements)
