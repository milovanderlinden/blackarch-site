title: "New tools: netcon.sh and strap.sh"
---

BlackArch now comes with [netcon.sh](https://github.com/BlackArch/netcon), a script to establish network connections with the option to spoof MAC addresses, hostnames, clientids, etc.


Also, we simplified the [installation instructions](http://blackarch.org/downloads.html) with a new script: [strap.sh](/strap.sh).
