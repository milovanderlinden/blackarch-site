Today we released new BlackArch ISOs. This is just a Bugfix release and shrinks the ISO size for DVD-R. For more details see the ChangeLog below.

Here's the ChangeLog :

* Bugfix: blackarch-installer
* shrink ISO size (DVD-R support)
* updated all blackarch packages
* updated all system packages

We wish to thank all of BlackArch users, mirrors, and supporters. Thanks for your help.
