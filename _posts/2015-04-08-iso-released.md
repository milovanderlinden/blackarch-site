title: New ISOs released (Bugfixes)
---

Today we released new BlackArch ISOs. The new ISOs include over 1200 tools for i686 and x86_64 and over 1000 tools for armv6h and armv7h. This release includes bugfixes and SHA1 sum checks for our strap.sh script in the installer. For more details see the ChangeLog below.

Here's the ChangeLog :

* added README
* fix pacman.conf settings: replace HoldPkg settings with IgnorePkg
* updated blackarch-install-scripts (add missing packages, check SHA 1 sum of strap.sh, and more...)
* updated system packages including linux kernel 3.19.3, and more...
* updated tools (version bumps)

We wish to thank all of BlackArch users, mirrors, and supporters. Thanks for your help.
