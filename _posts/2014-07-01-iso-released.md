A short ChangeLog:

* added new gtk theme
* added more locales for lxdm and system
* replaced wallpaper and logos
* added bash completions
* added exploits to /usr/share/exploits using sploitctl
* added a bunch of new tools / updated tools (more than 1000)
* added new packages with help flags to each wm's menus

We wanted to say "thank you" to all users and supporters of BlackArch Linux who contributed, donated and motivated us for testings, fixes and improvements.
