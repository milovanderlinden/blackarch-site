title: The end of i686 support!
---

Following 9 months of deprecation period, support for the i686 architecture effectively ends today. By the end of November, i686 packages will be removed from our mirrors and later from the packages archive.

We wish to thank all of BlackArch's users, mirrors, and supporters. Thanks for your help.
