title: Extended downtime!
---

We're continuing work to upgrade our infrastructure, as a part of this improvement our domain service provider experienced some issues which resulted in slow proprogation of our DNS records across the globe. This was the root cause of our extended downtime. This issue has now been corrected, we apologize for the inconvenience.
